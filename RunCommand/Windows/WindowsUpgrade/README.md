# Windows In-Place Upgrade Assessment Script

## Overview

This PowerShell script is designed to assess the readiness of a Windows machine (desktop or server) for an **in-place OS upgrade**, with special considerations for **Azure VMs**. It evaluates OS version, supported upgrade paths, system disk space, and Azure security features like **Trusted Launch**, **Secure Boot**, and **vTPM**.

## Key Features

- **OS Version Detection**
  - Identifies whether the system is Windows 10, 11, or a Windows Server edition.
- **Server Upgrade Path Check**
  - Matches current server version to supported upgrade targets.
- **Hardware Validation**
  - Disk space (≥ 64 GB)
  - Physical memory (≥ 4 GB)
- **Azure VM Security Feature Verification**
  - Trusted Launch
  - Secure Boot
  - Virtual TPM
- **Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) Detection**
  - Flags unsupported pooled host pool configurations.
- **Upgrade Recommendations**
  - Outputs supported upgrade paths or relevant upgrade guidance.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or later.
- Script must be run with administrative privileges.
- To retrieve Azure instance metadata, script must be executed on an **Azure VM** with **instance metadata service** access enabled.
