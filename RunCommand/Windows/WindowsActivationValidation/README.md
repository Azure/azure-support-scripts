# Windows activation validation

This PowerShell script is designed to assist with diagnosing Windows licensing and connectivity issues on Azure virtual machines (VMs). It performs a series of checks to verify:


## What It Does

1. **WinRM Service Check**  
   - Ensures the `WinRM` service is running.
   - Attempts to start the service if it's not already running.

2. **Azure Edition Detection**  
   - Detects if the machine is using an **Azure edition** of Windows.
   - Verifies connectivity to the **Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**.
   - Checks for any missing root certificates in the attestation document.

3. **KMS Endpoint Validation**  
   - Retrieves the configured KMS endpoint from the Windows registry.
   - Falls back to the default Azure KMS endpoint if none is found.
   - Tests TCP connectivity to the KMS endpoint on port `1688`.

4. **Windows Activation Check & Attempt**  
   - Checks current activation status.
   - If not activated, attempts to activate using `slmgr.vbs`.
   - Parses and displays activation error codes with direct links to Microsoft troubleshooting documentation.
