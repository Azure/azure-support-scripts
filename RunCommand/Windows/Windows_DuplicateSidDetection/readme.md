# Windows Duplicate SID Detection

## Overview
`Windows_DuplicateSidDetection.ps1` is a PowerShell script that scans the **netsetup.log** file on a Windows system to detect indicators of **duplicate Security Identifier (SID)** or machine account conflicts. These issues typically occur when a computer account already exists in Active Directory or when a SID mismatch prevents domain join operations.

---

## What the Script Does
- Dynamically retrieves the Windows directory using `$env:SystemRoot`.
- Reads the `netsetup.log` file to identify patterns that indicate:
  - **Account already exists** errors.
  - **NetUserAdd failed: 0x8b0** (commonly linked to SID conflicts).
- Outputs matching log lines for each pattern.
- Summarizes whether a duplicate SID or machine account issue was detected.
- Provides a reference link to official Microsoft documentation for troubleshooting.

## Why This Matters
Duplicate SIDs or machine account conflicts can:
- Block domain join or rejoin operations.
- Cause authentication failures and group policy issues.
- Lead to security and compliance risks if not resolved promptly.

## Usage
1. Place the script on the target Windows machine.
2. Run it in **PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   .\Windows_DuplicateSidDetection.ps1
