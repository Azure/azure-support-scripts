# Enable Emergency Management Services (EMS)

## Overview
This RunCommand script enables **Emergency Management Services (EMS)** on an Azure Virtual Machine.  
EMS provides out-of-band management and debugging access via a serial port, which can be useful for troubleshooting unresponsive systems.

## What the Script Does
- Enables EMS on the **current boot entry**.  
- Configures EMS settings to use:
  - **Port:** COM1  
  - **Baud Rate:** 115200  

## Important Notes

- **Security Risk**: EMS provides low-level access to the system. Ensure that only trusted administrators have access to the serial console.  
- **Azure Serial Console**: EMS must be enabled for the VM to use Azureâ€™s built-in **Serial Console** for troubleshooting.  
- **Reboot Required**: A VM reboot is required for EMS settings to take effect.  
- **Disable if not needed**: EMS should be disabled when not actively in use to reduce exposure.  

## Usage

1. Run the script using **Azure VM RunCommand** or another remote execution method.  
2. Restart the VM for the EMS configuration to take effect.  
3. Access the VM via the **Azure Serial Console** or other supported tools.
